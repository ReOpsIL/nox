# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Nox task management system provides basic CRUD operations and Claude CLI execution, but lacks sophisticated workflow capabilities that would enable more complex, multi-step agent coordination and task orchestration. This feature will enhance the task management system with advanced workflow capabilities including task dependencies, conditional execution, parallel processing, task templates, and improved monitoring.

The enhanced task management workflows will transform Nox from a simple task executor into a powerful orchestration platform capable of handling complex, multi-agent workflows with proper error handling, retry mechanisms, and real-time progress tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create task workflows with dependencies, so that I can orchestrate complex multi-step processes across multiple agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task THEN I SHALL be able to specify prerequisite tasks that must complete before this task can start
2. WHEN I create a task workflow THEN the system SHALL automatically schedule dependent tasks only after their prerequisites are completed
3. WHEN a prerequisite task fails THEN the system SHALL block dependent tasks and provide clear failure notifications
4. WHEN I view a task THEN I SHALL see its dependency graph and current blocking status
5. IF a task has multiple prerequisites THEN the system SHALL wait for all prerequisites to complete successfully before starting the task

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to create reusable task templates, so that I can standardize common workflows and reduce configuration overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task template THEN I SHALL be able to define parameterized task configurations with variable placeholders
2. WHEN I instantiate a template THEN the system SHALL substitute template variables with provided values
3. WHEN I create a template THEN I SHALL be able to include dependency relationships and execution parameters
4. WHEN I list templates THEN the system SHALL show available templates with their descriptions and required parameters
5. IF a template parameter is missing during instantiation THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want tasks to have retry mechanisms and error handling policies, so that transient failures don't require manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task THEN I SHALL be able to specify retry count, backoff strategy, and failure conditions
2. WHEN a task fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry according to the configured policy
3. WHEN maximum retries are exceeded THEN the system SHALL mark the task as failed and trigger configured error handlers
4. WHEN a task is retrying THEN the system SHALL log retry attempts with timestamps and failure reasons
5. IF a task has a timeout configured THEN the system SHALL terminate long-running tasks and mark them as timed out

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow orchestrator, I want to execute tasks in parallel when possible, so that I can optimize workflow execution time and resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create multiple independent tasks THEN the system SHALL execute them concurrently up to configured limits
2. WHEN I configure parallel execution limits THEN the system SHALL respect per-agent and global concurrency constraints
3. WHEN parallel tasks complete THEN the system SHALL immediately start any newly eligible dependent tasks
4. WHEN I monitor workflow execution THEN I SHALL see real-time status of all parallel task executions
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL queue tasks and execute them as resources become available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system monitor, I want comprehensive workflow progress tracking and notifications, so that I can observe and respond to workflow execution in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is executing THEN I SHALL receive real-time progress updates via WebSocket connections
2. WHEN workflow milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL send configurable notifications (completion, failure, delays)
3. WHEN I query workflow status THEN I SHALL see detailed progress including task completion percentages and estimated time remaining
4. WHEN workflows encounter issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error context and suggested remediation steps
5. IF a workflow is taking longer than expected THEN the system SHALL send proactive delay notifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want conditional task execution based on previous task results, so that I can create dynamic workflows that adapt based on intermediate outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task THEN I SHALL be able to specify conditions based on predecessor task outputs or status
2. WHEN a conditional task is evaluated THEN the system SHALL execute the task only if conditions are met
3. WHEN conditions are not met THEN the system SHALL skip the task and continue with the workflow
4. WHEN I define conditions THEN I SHALL be able to use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) and comparison operators
5. IF condition evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and treat it as a condition failure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want workflow scheduling capabilities, so that I can automate recurring workflows and time-based task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a workflow THEN I SHALL be able to schedule it for future execution with cron-like expressions
2. WHEN scheduled time arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically instantiate and execute the workflow
3. WHEN I create recurring workflows THEN the system SHALL handle schedule conflicts and overlapping executions
4. WHEN I manage schedules THEN I SHALL be able to pause, resume, and modify scheduled workflows
5. IF a scheduled workflow fails THEN the system SHALL apply configured retry and notification policies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want workflow execution history and analytics, so that I can optimize workflow performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows execute THEN the system SHALL record detailed execution metrics including duration, resource usage, and success rates
2. WHEN I query workflow history THEN I SHALL be able to filter by date range, agent, status, and workflow type
3. WHEN I analyze performance THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated statistics and trend analysis
4. WHEN I identify bottlenecks THEN the system SHALL highlight slow tasks and resource constraints
5. IF workflows show performance degradation THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for optimization
