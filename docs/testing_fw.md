# NOX Project TUI Testing Tool Specification

## Overview
Create a comprehensive testing framework for the NOX project that systematically validates all Text User Interface (TUI) screens and their keyboard interactions. This tool will serve as an automated quality assurance system to identify bugs and ensure proper functionality across the entire TUI experience.

## Core Requirements

### 1. TUI Screen Discovery and Analysis
- **Automatically discover all TUI screens** in the NOX project
- **Map the complete navigation flow** between screens
- **Identify all available keyboard shortcuts** for each screen
- **Document the expected functionality** for each keybinding
- **Create a comprehensive inventory** of all interactive elements

### 2. Keybinding Documentation System
Generate a structured catalog that includes:
- **Screen Name** (e.g., "Agents Screen", "Configuration Screen")
- **Key Combination** (e.g., 'U', 'Ctrl+R', 'Enter')
- **Function Description** (e.g., "Update Agent", "Refresh Display", "Confirm Selection")
- **Expected Behavior** (detailed description of what should happen)
- **Prerequisites** (any conditions that must be met for the key to work)

### 3. Automated Test Procedure Generator
For each identified keybinding, create:
- **Setup procedures** to reach the target screen state
- **Key simulation logic** to programmatically trigger the keybinding
- **Validation checkpoints** to verify expected outcomes
- **Cleanup procedures** to reset state for subsequent tests
- **Error recovery mechanisms** for graceful failure handling

### 4. Advanced Logging and Monitoring System
Implement comprehensive instrumentation:
- **Application state hooks** to monitor internal state changes
- **Event logging** to track all user interactions and system responses
- **Performance metrics** to identify slow or hanging operations
- **Error detection** with stack trace capture
- **Debug logging levels** for granular troubleshooting
- **Log aggregation** for pattern analysis across test runs

### 5. Intelligent Test Execution Engine
- **Sequential test execution** with proper state management
- **Parallel testing capability** where appropriate
- **Test isolation** to prevent interference between tests
- **Retry mechanisms** for flaky tests
- **Timeout handling** for unresponsive operations
- **Real-time progress reporting** during test execution

### 6. Comprehensive Reporting System
Generate detailed reports including:
- **Executive Summary Table** showing OK/ERROR status for each key on each screen
- **Detailed Error Analysis** with categorized failure types
- **Performance Metrics** (response times, resource usage)
- **Code Coverage Reports** highlighting untested paths
- **Trend Analysis** comparing results across test runs
- **Actionable Recommendations** for fixing identified issues

### 7. Claude Code Integration Framework
Prepare structured data for automated debugging:
- **Error classification** with severity levels and categories
- **Root cause analysis hints** based on error patterns
- **Code location mapping** linking errors to specific source files
- **Suggested fix templates** for common error types
- **Enhanced logging recommendations** for better debugging
- **Test case expansion suggestions** for improved coverage

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Discovery and Mapping
1. **Code analysis** to identify all TUI screen definitions
2. **Dynamic screen detection** during runtime
3. **Keybinding extraction** from event handlers and documentation
4. **Navigation flow mapping** through state transitions

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure
1. **Test harness development** with mock input capabilities
2. **Logging framework integration** with configurable verbosity
3. **State management system** for test isolation
4. **Report generation engine** with multiple output formats

### Phase 3: Execution and Analysis
1. **Automated test suite execution**
2. **Real-time monitoring and logging**
3. **Error pattern detection and classification**
4. **Performance baseline establishment**

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
1. **Claude Code integration** for automated debugging
2. **Continuous improvement** based on test results
3. **Enhanced logging implementation** for better visibility
4. **Test suite expansion** based on discovered edge cases

## Success Criteria
- **100% keybinding coverage** across all TUI screens
- **Reliable error detection** with minimal false positives
- **Actionable error reports** that enable quick debugging
- **Seamless Claude Code integration** for automated issue resolution
- **Maintainable test suite** that evolves with the codebase
- **Performance benchmarking** for regression detection

## Deliverables
1. **Testing framework source code** with full documentation
2. **Comprehensive test suite** covering all identified functionality
3. **Detailed keybinding reference** for the NOX project
4. **Sample test reports** demonstrating the output format
5. **Integration guide** for Claude Code automated debugging
6. **Maintenance documentation** for ongoing test suite updates

This testing tool will serve as both a quality assurance mechanism and a foundation for automated bug fixing through Claude Code integration, ultimately improving the reliability and user experience of the NOX project's TUI interface.
