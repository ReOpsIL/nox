```

## Implementation Status Summary

### Fully Implemented Features ‚úÖ

   - Comprehensive structure but not operational

## Recommendations

### For Development Teams
1. **Focus on Core Features**: The CLI-based functionality is fully operational and tested
2. **API Development**: Complete the partially implemented API endpoints before adding new features
3. **Fix WebSocket Issues**: Address the documented WebSocket stability problems before production use
4. **Phase 3 Development**: Treat Phase 3 features as architectural frameworks requiring significant implementation work

### For Users
1. **Production Use**: CLI functionality is production-ready
2. **API Integration**: Use with caution, verify endpoint availability before integration
3. **WebSocket**: Avoid using WebSocket functionality until issues are resolved
4. **Advanced Features**: Do not rely on Phase 3 features for production use

### For Documentation Maintenance
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep implementation status current as development progresses
2. **Clear Marking**: Continue using status badges (‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùåüîÆ) to indicate feature readiness
3. **Test Results**: Update test documentation based on actual test execution results
4. **Issue Tracking**: Maintain links to known issue documentation

## Conclusion

The Nox project documentation has been comprehensively updated to accurately reflect the current implementation state. The core CLI functionality is fully operational and well-documented, while advanced features exist as architectural frameworks ready for future development. Users and developers now have clear visibility into what is currently usable versus what is planned for future releases.
