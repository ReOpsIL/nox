# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Nox TUI provides basic navigation and display functionality but lacks essential interactive capabilities for managing agents and tasks. Users can view agents and tasks but cannot perform management operations like creating, starting, stopping, or deleting them directly from the TUI interface. The TUI displays keybinding hints for these operations but they are not implemented, creating a frustrating user experience.

This feature will complete the basic TUI functionality by implementing all the missing keybindings, interactive forms, confirmation dialogs, and error handling that users expect from a fully functional terminal user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage agents directly from the TUI interface, so that I can perform all agent operations without switching to CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press 'N' in the Agents screen THEN the system SHALL display a form to create a new agent
2. WHEN I press 'S' on a selected agent THEN the system SHALL start the agent and update its status
3. WHEN I press 'T' on a selected agent THEN the system SHALL stop the agent and update its status
4. WHEN I press 'D' on a selected agent THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before deleting
5. WHEN I press 'E' on a selected agent THEN the system SHALL display a form to edit the agent's system prompt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a task manager, I want to manage tasks directly from the TUI interface, so that I can create, execute, and cancel tasks without using CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press 'N' in the Tasks screen THEN the system SHALL display a form to create a new task
2. WHEN I press 'E' on a selected task THEN the system SHALL execute the task and show progress
3. WHEN I press 'C' on a selected task THEN the system SHALL cancel the task with confirmation
4. WHEN I press 'U' on a selected task THEN the system SHALL display a form to update task details
5. WHEN I press 'D' on a selected task THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before deleting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive forms for data entry in the TUI, so that I can input agent and task information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new agent THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for name and system prompt
2. WHEN I create a new task THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for title, description, and agent selection
3. WHEN I edit an agent THEN the system SHALL pre-populate fields with current values
4. WHEN I submit a form THEN the system SHALL validate input and show errors if invalid
5. WHEN I press Escape in a form THEN the system SHALL cancel the operation and return to the previous screen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want confirmation dialogs for destructive operations, so that I can avoid accidentally deleting agents or tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt to delete an agent THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with agent details
2. WHEN I attempt to delete a task THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with task details
3. WHEN I confirm deletion THEN the system SHALL perform the operation and show success feedback
4. WHEN I cancel deletion THEN the system SHALL return to the previous screen without changes
5. WHEN I attempt to stop an active agent THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback and error handling in the TUI, so that I understand the status of my operations and can respond to failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an operation succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success message with details
2. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with the failure reason
3. WHEN I perform a long-running operation THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
4. WHEN I execute a task THEN the system SHALL show real-time execution status
5. WHEN network or system errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want filtering and search capabilities in the TUI, so that I can quickly find specific agents or tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press '/' in any list screen THEN the system SHALL activate search mode
2. WHEN I type in search mode THEN the system SHALL filter the list in real-time
3. WHEN I press 'F' THEN the system SHALL show filter options for status, priority, or agent
4. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL update the list and show filter indicators
5. WHEN I clear filters THEN the system SHALL restore the full list

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and navigation hints, so that I can efficiently use the TUI without memorizing all commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press '?' or F1 THEN the system SHALL display a help screen with all available keybindings
2. WHEN I navigate between screens THEN the system SHALL show context-appropriate keybinding hints
3. WHEN I am in a form or dialog THEN the system SHALL show relevant navigation options
4. WHEN I use Tab or Shift+Tab THEN the system SHALL navigate between form fields or UI elements
5. WHEN I press Escape THEN the system SHALL cancel the current operation or go back one level

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the TUI to maintain state and context, so that my selections and filters persist during my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between screens THEN the system SHALL remember my selected agent or task
2. WHEN I return to a screen THEN the system SHALL restore my previous scroll position
3. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL maintain them until explicitly cleared
4. WHEN I perform operations THEN the system SHALL refresh data while preserving context
5. WHEN I resize the terminal THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
