# Testing Predefined Agents Integration

## Test Script

1. **Build the system**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --bin nox-tui
   ```

2. **Ensure config file exists**:
   - The `config/predefined_agents.yaml` file should be present
   - Contains 5 categories: rust_cli, fullstack_web, documentation, maintenance, planning
   - Contains 8 predefined agents with their tasks

3. **Run the TUI**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin nox-tui
   ```

4. **Navigation Testing**:
   - Start on Dashboard (Screen 1)
   - Press Tab or arrow keys to navigate to "Predefined Agents" screen (Screen 6)
   - Should see categories on the left and agents on the right

5. **Category Navigation**:
   - Use ↑↓ keys to navigate between categories
   - Should see agents update when category changes
   - Categories should include:
     - Rust CLI Development
     - Fullstack Web Development  
     - Documentation Master
     - Code Maintenance
     - Project Planning

6. **Agent Selection**:
   - Use ←→ keys to navigate between agents
   - Use Space to select/deselect agents (checkbox should toggle)
   - Use 'A' to select all agents in category
   - Use 'N' to deselect all agents

7. **Agent Loading**:
   - Select one or more agents with Space
   - Press Enter to load selected agents into Nox
   - Should see progress dialog
   - Should see success message with number of agents and tasks loaded

8. **Verification**:
   - Navigate to Agents screen (Tab or Screen 2)
   - Should see the loaded agents in the list
   - Navigate to Tasks screen (Tab or Screen 3)
   - Should see the tasks created from the agent templates

9. **Agent Details**:
   - In Predefined Agents screen, select an agent
   - Should see agent details on the bottom: description, capabilities, default tasks
   - Should see task details with estimated duration and priority

## Expected Results

- ✅ YAML config loads successfully
- ✅ Categories display correctly
- ✅ Agents display correctly per category
- ✅ Agent selection works (checkboxes)
- ✅ Agent loading creates real Nox agents and tasks
- ✅ Tasks include implementation steps from templates
- ✅ Navigation between screens works
- ✅ Help screens include predefined agents info

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Category-based organization** of specialized AI agents
2. **Multi-selection** of agents for bulk loading
3. **Template-based task creation** with detailed steps
4. **Real-time integration** with Nox agent ecosystem
5. **Comprehensive TUI interface** with help and navigation
6. **Structured task breakdown** from templates
7. **Agent specialization** by domain (Rust, Web, Documentation, etc.)

## Example Usage Flow

1. User needs to build a Rust CLI application
2. Navigate to Predefined Agents screen
3. Select "Rust CLI Development" category
4. See "Rust CLI Expert" and "Rust TUI Specialist" agents
5. Select both agents with Space
6. Press Enter to load them
7. Navigate to Tasks screen to see:
   - "Set up basic CLI structure" 
   - "Implement file I/O operations"
   - "Set up TUI application structure"
   - "Implement interactive components"
8. Each task includes detailed implementation steps

This demonstrates how the predefined agent system enables quick project setup with specialized AI agents and structured tasks.
