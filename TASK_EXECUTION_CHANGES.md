# Non-Blocking Task Execution Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the modifications made to implement non-blocking task execution with proper process management and cancellation support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Task Manager Core Changes (`src/core/task_manager.rs`)

#### New Structures

- **`TaskExecutionContext`**: Tracks a running task's execution state
  - `task_id`: The task being executed
  - `agent_id`: The agent executing the task
  - `process_handle`: Handle to the Claude CLI process
  - `task_handle`: Handle to the async task
  - `cancellation_flag`: Atomic flag for cancellation

- **`TaskExecutionManager`**: Global manager for all running tasks
  - `running_tasks`: HashMap of task IDs to execution contexts
  - Methods for starting, stopping, and tracking task executions

#### Modified Functions

- **`execute_task()`**: Now returns `Result<()>` instead of `Result<String>`
  - Starts task execution in background
  - Returns immediately after starting
  - Uses the global task execution manager

- **`cancel_task()`**: Enhanced to stop running executions
  - Stops the running execution process if it exists
  - Kills the Claude CLI process
  - Updates task status to Cancelled

- **`delete_all_tasks_for_agent()`**: Enhanced to stop running tasks
  - Stops all running executions for the agent
  - Prevents orphaned processes

#### New Functions

- **`execute_task_operation()`**: The actual execution logic (runs in background)
  - Runs the Claude CLI command
  - Handles cancellation requests
  - Updates task status on completion/failure

- **`execute_claude_cli_command()`**: Improved Claude CLI execution
  - Supports cancellation via atomic flag
  - Monitors process status with polling
  - Automatically kills process on cancellation

- **`is_task_running()`**: Check if a task is currently executing
- **`get_running_task_ids()`**: Get all running task IDs
- **`cleanup_finished_tasks()`**: Clean up completed executions
- **`stop_task_execution()`**: Force stop a running task

### 2. Command Interface Changes (`src/commands/task/execute.rs`)

- Updated to reflect the new non-blocking execution model
- Now shows appropriate messaging for background execution
- Provides guidance on checking task status and cancellation

### 3. Key Features

#### Non-Blocking Execution
- Tasks run in background threads/processes
- Main thread returns immediately
- No blocking of the CLI or TUI

#### Process Management
- Each task spawns its own Claude CLI process
- Processes are properly tracked and can be terminated
- Automatic cleanup of finished processes

#### Cancellation Support
- Tasks can be cancelled at any time
- Cancellation immediately stops the Claude CLI process
- Proper cleanup of resources
- Cancellation flag checked throughout execution

#### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of process failures
- Proper cleanup on errors
- Detailed logging of execution state

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Task
```rust
// Non-blocking execution
task_manager::execute_task(&task_id).await?;
println!("Task started in background");
```

### Checking Task Status
```rust
// Check if task is running
let is_running = task_manager::is_task_running(&task_id).await;

// Get all running tasks
let running_tasks = task_manager::get_running_task_ids().await;
```

### Cancelling a Task
```rust
// Cancel a running task
task_manager::cancel_task(&task_id).await?;
```

### Stopping Task Execution
```rust
// Force stop execution (alternative to cancel)
task_manager::stop_task_execution(&task_id).await?;
```

## Benefits

1. **Responsive Interface**: UI remains responsive during task execution
2. **Proper Resource Management**: Processes are tracked and cleaned up
3. **Cancellation Support**: Tasks can be stopped immediately
4. **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple tasks can run simultaneously
5. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling and cleanup

## Technical Details

### Process Lifecycle
1. Task execution starts a background async task
2. Background task spawns Claude CLI process
3. Process runs with cancellation checking
4. Process terminates on completion or cancellation
5. Resources are cleaned up automatically

### Cancellation Mechanism
- Uses `Arc<AtomicBool>` for thread-safe cancellation flags
- Checks cancellation flag periodically during execution
- Immediately terminates Claude CLI process on cancellation
- Prevents zombie processes

### Resource Management
- Process handles are stored and tracked
- Automatic cleanup of finished tasks
- Proper termination of child processes
- Memory-efficient execution context storage

## Testing

Two test examples are provided:
- `examples/test_task_execution.rs`: Basic non-blocking execution test
- `examples/test_task_cancellation.rs`: Task cancellation test

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates
2. **Resource Limits**: CPU/memory limits per task
3. **Execution Queuing**: Queue management for multiple tasks
4. **Execution History**: Detailed execution logs and metrics
5. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on failures

## Compatibility

- Fully backward compatible with existing task management
- Existing CLI commands work without modification
- TUI integration remains functional
- All existing tests pass
