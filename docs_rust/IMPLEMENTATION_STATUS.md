# NOX Implementation Status - Rust Backend

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation status of the Rust backend for NOX, which replaces the previous TypeScript prototype.

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Features

### Core Infrastructure
- **Agent Registry**: TOML/JSON-based storage with CRUD operations
- **Task Management**: Markdown file tracking with status updates
- **CLI Interface**: Complete command-line tools for agent/task management
- **Web API Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for frontend integration
- **Configuration System**: TOML-based configuration management
- **File Watching**: Auto-reload task files when modified
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive Result<T, E> usage

### Agent Management
- Create agents with custom system prompts and capabilities
- List all agents with status indicators
- Delete individual agents or all agents (with cascade task deletion)
- Agent metadata tracking (creation time, last modified, etc.)
- Agent status monitoring (active/inactive)
- Resource limit definitions and enforcement

### Task System
- Create tasks assigned to specific agents
- Task priorities (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL)
- Task status workflow (todo ‚Üí inprogress ‚Üí done ‚Üí cancelled)
- Markdown-based task tracking per agent
- Task delegation between agents
- Task history and audit trail
- Cross-agent task dependencies

### API Routes for Frontend
- RESTful API endpoints for agent management
- Task CRUD operations via HTTP
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Structured JSON responses for PrimeReact frontend
- Pagination and filtering support
- WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

### Claude CLI Integration
- Basic agent spawning functionality
- Process management with proper error handling
- Agent-to-Claude communication framework
- Session persistence with recovery
- **Issues**: Connection timeouts, limited error recovery

### Git Versioning
- Git repository integration
- Commit functionality for registry changes
- **Missing**: Rollback operations, branch management, conflict resolution

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive Result<T, E> usage
- Structured logging with different levels
- **Issues**: Some edge cases not fully covered

### WebSocket Functionality
- Real-time connection between frontend and backend
- Event broadcasting with proper error handling
- **Issues**: Connection failures under high load

## ‚ùå Not Implemented (Planned)

### Inter-Agent Communication
- Agent-to-agent messaging protocols
- Community discovery and collaboration
- Agent relationship management
- Broadcast messaging system

### MCP Service Discovery
- Docker Hub service browsing
- Automatic MCP service installation
- Runtime capability expansion
- Service lifecycle management

### Advanced Agent Features
- Agent self-modification capabilities
- Dynamic prompt evolution
- Capability learning and adaptation
- Agent spawning by other agents

### Resource Management
- Memory/CPU usage enforcement
- Container lifecycle management
- Resource pool allocation
- Usage monitoring and limits

### Security Framework
- User approval workflows
- Permission gates for agent actions
- Sandboxing and isolation
- Anti-runaway protection

## üêõ Known Issues and Bugs

### Server Stability
- Some edge cases in concurrent operations
- Potential resource leaks in long-running processes
- Recovery from certain error states

### API Route Issues
- Rate limiting not fully implemented
- Some endpoints missing comprehensive validation
- Limited error feedback in certain scenarios

### Task Management Issues
- Potential race conditions in concurrent task updates
- Incomplete task output display
- Limited progress tracking

### Claude CLI Integration Problems
- Process spawning failures in certain environments
- Session timeout handling
- Limited error recovery
- Health monitoring improvements needed

## Architecture Decisions That Worked

### TOML/JSON-Based Storage
- Simple file-based storage proved reliable
- Easy to inspect and debug
- Git-friendly for version control
- No database dependency

### Markdown Task Files
- Human-readable task tracking
- Easy to edit manually
- Good for debugging and inspection
- Clear audit trail

### Separation of Concerns
- CLI, API server, and core logic as separate modules
- Clear API boundaries between components
- Modular Rust architecture with traits

### Clap CLI Framework
- Robust command-line interface
- Good help system and validation
- Easy to extend with new commands

### Actix Web for API Routes
- High-performance HTTP server
- Excellent middleware support
- Type-safe route handlers
- Good WebSocket integration

## Architecture Decisions That Need Improvement

### WebSocket Implementation
- Current implementation could be more robust
- Reconnection logic needs improvement
- Better error handling for dropped connections

### Process Management Approach
- Child process spawning could be more reliable
- Error recovery options limited
- Process lifecycle management complexity

## Implementation Plan for Remaining Features

### Phase 1: Core API Routes (Current Focus)
- Complete RESTful API endpoints for agent operations
- Task management routes
- Authentication and authorization
- Documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

### Phase 2: PrimeReact Frontend Integration
- API client library for frontend
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Comprehensive UI components
- Responsive design

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Inter-agent communication
- Enhanced security model
- Resource management
- Advanced task workflows

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion
- Plugin system
- Third-party integrations
- Cloud deployment options
- Multi-user support

This implementation plan prioritizes a solid, reliable backend with proper API routes to support the future PrimeReact frontend.
